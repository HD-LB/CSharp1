//For this task, use only the command line and a text editor.Create a folder(name it however you want), navigate into it and create a CLI.cs file. Open the CLI.cs file from the command line with whatever text editor you're comfortable with. Write a program that, when compiled to an executable, is run from the command line. Also, you should pass parameters(numbers) to it. Your executable should be called like that:

//./CLI.exe 1 20 33 45 66 17

//All parameters passed to your executable should be parsed to integers and summed. Print the sum on the console.
