//Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area and perimeter by given width and height.The width and height should be read from the console.

//Input
//•The input will consist of 2 lines: ◦On the first line, you will receive a floating-point number that will represent the width of the rectangle.
//◦On the second line, you will receive another floating-point number that will represent the height of the rectangle.



//Output
//•Output a single line - the rectangle's area and perimeter, separated by a whitespace. ◦Print the area and perimeter values with exactly 2-digits precision after the floating point
