//Write a program that reads two double values from the console A and B, stores them in variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.Use an if-statement.As a result print the values of the variables A and B, separated by a space.

//Input
//•On the first line, you will receive the value of A
//•On the second line, you will receive the value of B

//Output
//•On the only output line, print the values of the two variables, separated by a whitespace
