using System;

//You are given a list of N numbers.
//Get the most right 30 bits of every number and concatenate them.
//Write a program to find the length of the longest sequence of ones and the length of the longest sequence of zeroes from the obtained concatenated sequence.
//See examples for clarification.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console.
//On the first line there will be the number N.
//On each of the next N lines there will be a number from the list.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described.There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output data should be printed on the console.
//On the first output line print the length of the longest sequence of ones.
//On the third output line print the length of the longest sequence of zeroes.
//Constraints
//•	N will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
//•	All numbers will be integers between 0 and 1073741823, inclusive.
//•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.Allowed memory: 16 MB.
